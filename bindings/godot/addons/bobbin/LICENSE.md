# Bobbin License

Copyright (c) 2025 Snowfrog Studio (Philippe Vaillancourt inc.)

In short: Use Bobbin to make games, including commercial ones.
Don't repackage it and sell it as a tool.

---

You can:

- Use Bobbin in your projects, including commercial games
- Modify the code to fit your needs
- Ship it as part of your game or application
- Build internal tools or editor plugins that help you work with Bobbin

Please:

- Keep this license file with the code
- Credit "Bobbin dialogue system by Snowfrog Studio" in your game's credits
  screen where players can see it. For non-game projects, a mention
  in your docs or README is fine.

Don't:

- Sell Bobbin itself, or a modified version, as a standalone product
- Distribute Bobbin, or a modified version, as a tool, library, or asset
  for others to use in their projects — free or paid

To be clear: using Bobbin in a game is fine. Distributing Bobbin so that
other developers can use it in their games is not — that's what this
license is for.

These rules apply to modified versions too. If you break these terms,
your permission to use Bobbin ends.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

Bobbin is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind. I make no
promises that it's free of bugs, fit for any particular purpose,
or won't break your project.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

I'm not liable for any issues that come from using Bobbin. By using
it, you agree not to hold me responsible for any damages or legal
claims related to its use.

Are you a studio lawyer whose eye is twitching because this isn't MIT?
Let's chat. I don't bite, and I'm open to alternative arrangements for
the right situation. <phil@snowfrog.dev>
