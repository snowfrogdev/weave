Long ago, in a kingdom by the sea...
There lived a young wanderer with no name.
One day, she came upon a crossroads.
- Take the mountain path
- Follow the river
- Rest here for the night
The wanderer made her choice and continued on.
As the sun began to set, she encountered a mysterious stranger.
"Greetings, traveler," the stranger said. "What brings you to these lands?"
- "I seek adventure and fortune."
- "I am looking for someone."
- "I'm just passing through."
The stranger nodded thoughtfully.
"Very well. May your journey be fruitful."
And so the wanderer continued, her destiny yet unwritten.
The end.
