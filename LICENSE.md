# Weave License

Copyright (c) 2025 Philippe Vaillancourt

In short: Use Weave to make games, including commercial ones.
Don't repackage it and sell it as a tool.

---

You can:

- Use Weave in your projects, including commercial games
- Modify the code to fit your needs
- Ship it as part of your game or application
- Build internal tools or editor plugins that help you work with Weave

Please:

- Keep this license file with the code
- Credit "Weave by Philippe Vaillancourt" in your game's credits
  screen where players can see it. For non-game projects, a mention
  in your docs or README is fine.

Don't:

- Sell Weave itself, or a modified version, as a standalone product
- Distribute Weave, or a modified version, as a tool, library, or asset
  for others to use in their projects — free or paid

To be clear: using Weave in a game is fine. Distributing Weave so that
other developers can use it in their games is not — that's what this
license is for.

These rules apply to modified versions too. If you break these terms,
your permission to use Weave ends.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

Weave is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind. I make no
promises that it's free of bugs, fit for any particular purpose,
or won't break your project.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

I'm not liable for any issues that come from using Weave. By using
it, you agree not to hold me responsible for any damages or legal
claims related to its use.

Are you a studio lawyer whose eye is twitching because this isn't MIT?
Let's chat. I don't bite, and I'm open to alternative arrangements for
the right situation. <phil@snowfrog.dev>
